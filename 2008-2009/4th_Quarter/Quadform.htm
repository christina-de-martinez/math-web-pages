<h1>The Quadratic Formula</h1>
A good way to solve an equation in standard form (ax^2+bx+c=0) is by using the quadratic formula. At first, it seems hard to do. It looks like some crazy insane college math, but really, it's quite simple.
<br>
This is what the quadratic formula looks like<br>

The part underneath the square root symbol is called the <i>discriminant</i>. It has the name because it helps you discriminate how many roots, or solutions, the problem has. If the numeric value of the discriminant is negative, there are no roots. If it is positive, there are two. If it is 0, there is one.
