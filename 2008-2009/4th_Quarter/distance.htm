<h1><center>Distance Formula</center></h1>
Using the distance formula, you can find the distance between any two points on a graph. For example, if you walked 3 blocks to the east of your house and two blocks north, you can find how far away from your house you are as a bird flies.
<br>
All you have to do is substitute numbers in for variables.
