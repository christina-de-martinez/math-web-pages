<h1><center>Implementing the Distance Formula</center></h1>
Using the distance formula, you can find the distance between any two points on a chart. On a previous webpage, I've given you the formula, but how do you use it? <br>

Well, if you feel like jogging, and you start out at your house (0,0) and go 4 blocks West (-4,0), and then turn north and go 4 blocks north (-4, -4), how far are you away from your house as a bird flies?
<br>
This could be really complicated, OR you could use the distance formula! yay! 
<br>
All you do is substitute the numbers.
<br>
To find the distance between (0,0) and (-4,-4), you need to substitute the numbers in.  For example, <br>
d= &radic; ((0--4)<sup>2</sup>+(0--4)<sup>2</sup>)
<br>
Then simplify.
<br>
d= &radic; (16+16)
