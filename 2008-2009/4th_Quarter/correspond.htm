<h1>Corresponding Angles</h1>
<hr color="yellow">
<br>
Another way to see if the triangles are similar is with proportions.<br>
<img src="tri2.bmp"><br>
The angles that correspond are: <br>
angle A and angle D,<br>
angle B and angle E, <br>
angle C and angle F.<br>
<br>So....
<br>
line AB and line DE correspond, also. Just like
<br>
line BC and line EF,
<br>
and line AC and line DF.
<br><br>
So if lines AB and DE are proportional, it is a similar triangle. For example, 2 and 4 are similar. 2 is a half of 4. 5 and 2.5 are similar. 2.5 is a half of 5. 6 and 3 are similar. 3 is a half of 6.
<br>
<br>
Therefore, the triangles are similar.
