<h1>Similar Triangles</h1>
<hr color="yellow">
<br>
Similar triangles are triangles that are the same shape. They don't have to be the same size, but just the same shape.
<br>
One way to check whether or not two triangles are similar is by measuring the angles.
<br>
If the measures of the angles are the same, then the triangles are similar. 
<br>
For example:<br>
<img src="tri.bmp"><br>
These triangles are similar because of the similarity in angles.<br>
