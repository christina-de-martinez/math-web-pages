<h1>Rate of Change</h1>
<br>
The Rate of Change is a ratio that describes, on average, how much one quantity changes with respect to a change in another quantity. If <i>x</i> is the independent variable and <i>y</i> is the dependent variable, then the rate of change is the change in y divided by the change in x.<br>
