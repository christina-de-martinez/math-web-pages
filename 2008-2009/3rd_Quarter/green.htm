Factors are numbers that are multiplied to get the resulting product. For example, 3 is a product of 9 because 3 times 3 is 9. Also, 2 is a factor of 8, because 2 times 4 is 8.<br><br>
Prime factorization is when a number is expressed as all its prime factors multiplied. For example, 4 would be expressed as 2 times 2.
