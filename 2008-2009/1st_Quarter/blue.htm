<h1>Open Sentences</h1>
A math statement with 1 or more variables (letters that show there is an unknown number in the equation or statement) is called an open sentence. The way you find out what the variable is is called solving the open sentence. What it ends up to be is called the solution, and a sentence that has an equal sign (=) is an equation. 
<p>
Which one of these is NOT an open sentence?
<br>
A: x+4-5<br>
B: 3-I+2<br>
C: 5-2+6<br>
D: y-6+3=6<p>
The answer is C. It doesn't have any variables in it.
