<h1>2 Properties</h1>
<br>
<h2>Commutative</h2>
To figure out a multipication problem, you can use the distributive property to make it more simple.
<br>
For Example:
<br>
(10x80)x3 is probably a lot easier to figure out using mental math than (80x3)x10.

<h2>Distributive</h2>
<br>
Another way you can figure out a multiplication problem easier is by using the Distributive property. 
You can rearrange how they are like this:
<br>
5(10+2) <br>
it's easier to do 5x10, or 50, and then add it to 5x2, or 10, than to do the whole thing. <br>
Then you end up with 60.
