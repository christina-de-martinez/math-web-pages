Today we will talk about using the metric system to measure.
<br>

<br>
1 in (inch) = 2.54 cm (centimeters) <br>
1 km (kilometer) = 1,000 m (meters)<br>
1 hm (hectometer) = 100 m<br>
1 dam (dekameter) = 10 m <br>
1 dm (decimeter) = .1 m <br>
1 cm = .01 m <br>
1 mm (milimeter) = .001 m <br>
<p>
What's cool about the metric system is that every prefix (something that comes before a word, such as kilo) is the same for every unit of measurement that we will talk about! Just change the suffix (the thing that comes after the prefix (example: kilometer. Meter is the suffix.).
