This is the math page that will show you how to write numbers as repetends.<br>
Here is an example: <br>
The number: 0.1111111111111111111...
<br>
The question: How do I write it easily, without any repeating or anything?<br>
The answer: All you do is make a bar over it, like this:
<br>
<img src="111.bmp"> <br>
Make sure it is clear that you have it over the number that repeats, you don't want anyone mixing it up in any way.See <a href="repetends2.htm">My other repetends page</a> to see how to write it with more than one repeating number.
