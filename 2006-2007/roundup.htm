<BODY bgcolor="#CC3399"><font color="#339966" face="carrol">We study rounding up and down in Math Class. This is how you round down. Here is how: <P>
Let's take the number<p>
656<p>
Let's say that we want to round up to the next ten. In the number 656, five is currently in the tens place. There is a six in the ones place.
We change the five up to a six. the new rounded up number is now:<p>
660<p>
To round 656 down to the nearest ten, the number would be:<p> 650.<p>
<hr>
Now let's round up.<p>
Let's say that we want to round 185 up to the nearest ten. There is a five in the ones place, and therefore we will change 185 to:<p>
190.<p>
Now let's round to the hundreds place. There is a 8 in the tens place, so you change the 185 to:<p>
200.<p>
I hope this webpage helped. Thanks for looking on my webpages and I hope you have good experiences in math!<p>
