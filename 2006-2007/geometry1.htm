<font color="#ccccff">Hi. I decided to make a wonderful page on Geometry. I hope you actually learn from this!<br>

<font color="#cc99cc"><img src="point.bmp">This is a Point. You write it like this: A<br>
That's because the point is named "A". Points are always named after a capitol letter, never a number or a name.
</font><br>
<font color="#ff99cc"><img src="line.bmp">
This is a line. It has two points on it, A and B. You name lines by what points are on it. For example, you would name this line "line AB". How you write this is put AB, and on top of that you put two arrows on each end of the line. For more information, click on the squarebelow:<br>
