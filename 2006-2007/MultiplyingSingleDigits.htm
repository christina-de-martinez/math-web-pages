Okay, let's say you wanted to see how much money you would spend at the dollar store if you bought 5 items. This is how you should write it at first: (Later you can do this in your head)<BR>
<pre>
	$1
	x5
   -------
</pre>
Next you need to solve this problem. you start at the bottom right corner and you say in your head: 'five times one dollar is what?' This means that you need to say: 'five one time is what?' The answer is five, so you write it like this:
<pre>
	$1
	x5
  -------
      $5
</pre><p>
