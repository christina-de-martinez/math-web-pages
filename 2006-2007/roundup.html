<BODY bgcolor="black"><font color="#339966">We study rounding up and down in Math Class. This is how you round down.  <P>
Let's take the number<p>
656
<hr><p>
Let's say that we want to round up to the next ten. In the number 656, five is currently in the tens place. There is a six in the ones place.
We change the five up to a six. the new rounded up number is now:<p>
660<hr><p>
To round 656 down to the nearest ten, the number would be:<p> 650. 
<p>Now let's round up to the next hundred. The six in the hundreds place will become a seven. The rounded up number will be 700. To round down to the nearest hundred, the six in the hundreds place will stay a six. The new rounded number will become:<p>
600.<hr>
<p>
Now let's round up.<p>
