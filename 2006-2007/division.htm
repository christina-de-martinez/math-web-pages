Let's say you and two of your friends have a lemonade stand. You got $15 in profits. Now you need to seperate the money between yourselves. This is a great time to divide!<br>
You need to separate $15 into 3 equal parts (awww, man!). This is how you write the problem on a piece of paper: <br>
<MAP NAME="map1">
	<AREA SHAPE="RECT" COORDS="10,40,23,22" HREF="three.htm" TITLE="3">
	<AREA SHAPE="RECT" COORDS="24,39,60,21" HREF="fifteen.htm" TITLE="15">
</MAP>
<IMG SRC="division.bmp" USEMAP="#map1" BORDER="0">
<br>
Now you solve it:<p><center>
<img src="division2.bmp"><p>

The reason you put the blank is because you could not put 3 into 1, the first number.
<p>
The reason you put the 5 next is because you can put the 3 into 15, the second number, 5 times.
<p>
The answer is $5.
I hope this guide helped you. Now you can have good experiences with all your division problems!
