Welcome to grownup math!!!</h1>
<br>
The reason I said grownup math is because we are now studying pi! <br>

Pi=3.14<br>
Pi is used to study the distance around the circle, or the circumference. How do you find the circumference using pi? <br>
First, you have to know what either the radius measurement is or the diameter measurement is. For the radius, just double the measurement and then multiply the radius by pi (3.14). If the radius measurement is 2.5, you multiply it by two, so that would be five, and then you multiply it by 3.14, or pi, to get 15.7. This would tell you the distance around the circle. Basically, the distance around the circle would be just over three times the diameter.
