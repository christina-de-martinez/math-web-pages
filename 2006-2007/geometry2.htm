<font size="5">Line Segments
</font>
In our 6th grade Mathematics textbooks, line segments are described as "A straight path of points between two points". They look like the picture below:

You name them by what points are on the segment. For example, in the picture above, the line segment is named "AB". You write it like this:

You name it by what two points end the segment.
