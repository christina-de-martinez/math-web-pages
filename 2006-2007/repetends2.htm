This is the math page that will show you how to write numbers as repetends.<br>
Here is an example: <br>
The number: 0.01010101010101010101...
<br>
The question: How do I write it easily, without any repeating or anything?<br>
The answer: All you do is make a bar over it, like this:
<br>
<img src="010101.bmp"> <br>
Make sure it is clear that you have it over both of the numbers that repeat, you don't want anyone mixing it up in any way.
