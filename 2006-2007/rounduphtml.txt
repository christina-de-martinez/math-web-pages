Let's take the number<p>
656<p>
Let's say that we want to round up to the next ten. In the number 656, five is currently in the tens place. There is a six in the ones place.
We change the five up to a six. the new rounded up number is now:<p>
660<p>
To round 656 down to the nearest ten, the number would be:<p> 650.
