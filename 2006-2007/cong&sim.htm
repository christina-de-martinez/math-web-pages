<h1>Congruent and similar figures</h1>
How do you tell whether things are congruent or similar? Well, I'll tell you!
Here is a picture of two circles. Try to tell whether they are similar or not... just to test you...<br>

The circles are similar; look at how the smaller one, circle A, is 2 units by 2 units. The larger one, circle B, is 4 units by 4 units.

To tell if something is congruent, look at the size and shape. If they are the exact same shape and size, they are congruent! See this example. <br>
