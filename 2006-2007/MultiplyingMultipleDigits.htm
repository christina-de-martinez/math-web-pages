<center><h1>Multiplying Multiple Digits</h1>
Multiplying Multiple digits is very useful for everything that you do. You use this method every day! Though multiplying may seem to be useless and boring, it does have a purpose.<p>
Math teachers are like all other teachers; they teach you very useful things. Pay a LOT of attention to them, it pays off. Not only in the gradebook, in your whole life.<p>
It may seem like I'm babbling on and on, so let's just get to the point.<p><hr><p>
Remember how we wrote single digits? Well it's the same with multiple (more than one) digits:
<pre>
88
x7
---
</pre>
<p>
Now, we start with the 7 and multiply it with 8. Seem familiar? The answer happens to be 56. What do we do now? Well, what you do if you have a double digit number is regroup/carry it. Yes, just like addition. now this is what it looks like:
<pre>
<sub>5</sub>
88
x7
---
 6
</pre>
Now what do we do with the 5? Just hang on, there! I'm explaining that next. When you multiply 7 with the other 8, you get what? 56 again! so you add that 5 that you were asking about to the 56 that you got. So now your problem looks like this:<p>
<pre>
<strike><sub>5</sub></strike>
88
x7
---
616
</pre>
<p>
Now you know how to multiply those kind of problems, how about these:
<hr>
Now you need to know how to multiply both numbers when they are BOTH more than one digit, like this:<p>
<pre>
88
x77
---
</pre>
<p>
Whoa! How do you do these? Well, you have to just shift lines and add a zero.
