Ambrose Everett Burnside
	He was fat, but kind. He was popular among the men that he was in command of. He had the most awesome side moustache thing in the whole Army of the Potomac. They called them “sideburns.” 
His subordinates cringed because Burnside was an accident looking for a place to happen. It was not that he didn’t recognize his own shortcomings as a commander. In fact, he refused command of the Army of the Potomac twice, citing his inexperience each time. Misfortune followed him wherever he went, and Burnside’s misfortune often spelled doom for his troops. 
Born in Liberty, Indiana, Burnside was a graduate of the United 
	
	Many battles in the Civil war were very important, and for very many reasons. INTRO INTRO INTRO INTRO INTRO INTRO INTRO INTRO INTRO INTRO
	Lincoln was embarrassed by how badly General McClellan was losing, so he replaced him with General Ambrose Burnside on November 7. He immediately started marching for the winter and went towards Richmond, which was the Confederate capitol. To go there, he had to go through Fredericksburg along the Rappahannock River. 
	 Fredericksburg was a very important strategic town. It was on the Rappahannock River, which leads out to the Chesapeake Bay. This was very important for getting supplies and troops to other port cities. The Federal army of the Potomac, with 115,000 men, got to Fredericksburg on November 17. There weren’t very many Confederates there, but the Federal army stopped on the East side of the Rappahannock anyways, opposite of Fredericksburg. He had ordered materials to make pontoon bridges, but they didn’t come for over a week, so he was delayed. 
	During this time, Lee took the time to put his 78,000 men on high ground behind the city. When Burnside’s pontoon bridges finally arrived on December 11, he crossed the river under sniper fire. When the Confederates fell back, the Federal soldiers stole stuff from Fredericksburg. Luckily for the citizens, they had been evacuated, because this was going to be a very bloody battle. 
	On December 13, Burnside prepared to attack Lee’s forces and drive them away to a set of hills by Fredericksburg. The main part of the attack fell on the Southern part of the city. Burnside attacked Prospect Hill, which wasn’t very effective. Meade’s army broke Jackson’s line but. Union generals C. Feger Jackson and George Bayard, and Confederate generals Thomas R.R. Cobb and Maxey Gregg were killed. On December 15, Burnside called off the offensive and recrossed the river, ending the campaign.  Burnside initiated a new offensive in January 1863, which quickly bogged down in the winter mud. The abortive “Mud March” and other failures led to Burnside’s replacement by Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker in January 1863.
