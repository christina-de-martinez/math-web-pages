Let's say that you went to the horsie store and bought a saddle at $150. If it is 33.3333...% off, how much is it?
<br>
To do this problem, you have to convert the decimal to a fraction. Multiply 33.3333...% by .01 or divide by 100. it comes to .33333333333333333333..... That means it is .3 with a repetend bar over the three. Which means it is a third. Take a third off of $150 to get $49.50. Then you subtract $49.50 from $150. That is $50! I hope you understood what I had to say. :)
