<center><h1>The Metric System</h1></center>
<hr color="#9966cc">
There are two different main types of measurements: The international (or Metric) system and the U.S. System.
<br>
The Metric system of measurement consists of mostly powers of ten, such as 1; 10; 100; and 1,000 and also .1; .01; .001, etc.<p>
The metric system is easier to use, also. powers of ten are simple to multiply and saying 10x10 is easier than saying what 8x4 equals.
<p>
Since the French developed it and we were not very good friends with France, the United States did not convert the U.S. system to the Metric system. We still do not use the Metric system much in America.
