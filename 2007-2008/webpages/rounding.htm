Equal fractions
<br>
If you have three pizzas, one that is split into quarters, one into eighths, and one into twelveths, and you eat three of the quarters, six of the eighths, and nine of the twelveths, which one of the pizzas will have the least number of pieces left?<br>
To solve that problem, you will need to know how to make equal fractions.<br>
Since three quarters, six eighths, and nine twelveths are the same thing, the pizzas will all have the same amount of pizza left.<br>  </h1>
