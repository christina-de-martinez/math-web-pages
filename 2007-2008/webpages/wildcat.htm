There are three types of estimating by rounding. One is rounding up, one is rounding down, and one is rounding to the nearest. 
<br>
If 38 is rounded up to the next ten, the result is 40. If it is rounded down to the nearest ten it is 30. If it is rounded to the nearest ten it is 40, also.<br> <hr>
